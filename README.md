# Waste Sorting

> **Abstract** : Waste management is a pressing global issue, with many cities struggling to implement efficient collection and disposal systems. Traditional waste management methods often fail to keep pace with increasing waste generation, leading to environmental and operational challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a transformative solution by integrating smart sensors, real-time data analytics, and automated processes to optimize waste collection and disposal. This study explores the limitations of conventional waste management approaches and highlights how IoT-based solutions can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and promote sustainability. By leveraging IoT technologies, municipalities and organizations can implement smarter waste management strategies, ensuring cleaner cities and a more sustainable future.
